 Overview

This project is a multilingual AI-based encryption and decryption system that securely protects text across 25+ global and extinct languages (including Selk’nam, Munichi, Serua, Chono, and Okawanuchu). It combines AES-GCM encryption for strong security and AWS Bedrock LLM for intelligent, meaningful text interpretation after decryption.
